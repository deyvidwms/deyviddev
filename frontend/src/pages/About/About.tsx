          <p>Hello, welcome to my space!</p>

          <p>
            I currently work as a full-stack developer for an international big
            tech company, contributing to the development of responsive web
            applications. On the front-end, I use technologies like HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, and TypeScript, along with frameworks such as React JS
            and Angular. On the backend, I specialize in Python with FastAPI.
          </p>

          <p>
            With 5 years of experience in the development field, Iâ€™ve worked
            with a wide range of technologies, methodologies, and professionals.
            My portfolio includes projects ranging from corporate websites to
            e-commerce platforms and advanced web systems used on a national and
            international scale. Whether working independently or as part of a
            team, I am always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies when
            necessary.
